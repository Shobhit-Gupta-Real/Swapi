# Star Wars Planets Showcase

Welcome to the Star Wars Planets Showcase, a web application that brings you information about planets from the Star Wars universe. This project integrates with the Star Wars API (SWAPI) to present details about each planet along with a list of notable residents.

# Overview

Mission was to create a web application that showcases Star Wars planets using the SWAPI, demonstrating proficiency in API integration, frontend development, and creating a responsive and stylish user interface.

# Features

- Planets Directory:
The application fetches and displays information about planets from the SWAPI at https://swapi.dev/api/planets/?format=json.
Each planet's data is presented in a distinct card, including the planet's name, climate, population, and terrain.
- Residents Display:
Within each planet's card, a list of residents is provided using their respective URLs found in the planet's data.
Relevant details such as the resident's name, height, mass, and gender are displayed.
- Pagination Mechanism:
Implemented pagination functionality to navigate through the list of planets, leveraging the "next" URL provided in the API's response for fetching additional pages.
User-friendly and intuitive pagination controls enhance the browsing experience.
- Styling and Responsiveness:
The application is styled using CSS, emphasizing a clean, engaging layout and responsive design.
Modern layout techniques such as Flexbox and transitions contribute to a consistent and appealing user experience across various devices and screen sizes.
- Framework/Library Choice:
The project is implemented using React.js
